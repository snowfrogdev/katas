# Sprint 2

## New Requirements

- Add a new `Celery` veggies option.
- Add a `Previous` button for each step of the process, except the first one. Hitting that button should take the user back to the previous step, obviously. As far as the stepper is comfirmed, all steps after the one being displayed on screen should be considered incomplete, even if the user has selected an option for these steps.

## Changes

- Marketing thinks we'll increase conversion if we swap the order of the `Cheese` and `Veggies` steps. Do that.

## Steps and choices
