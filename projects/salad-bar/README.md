# Salad Bar Kata

Source: https://github.com/snowfrogdev/katas

## Background

This kata puts you in the role of an Angular developer having to work with someone else's code. The current code base does not always follow best practices. You'll be presented with new requirements to implement. You'll find that implementing each new requirement with the current structure requires changes to many components and files.

The idea is for you to refactor the code as you implement the new requirements. The objective is that with successive improvements, each new requirement should be easier to implement. If you do a really good job of refactoring, the last change request should only require you to modify one or two lines of code.

## Learning Objectives

This kata should offer the opportunity to learn the advantages of applying some or all of the following techniques:

- [Loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)
- [Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)
- [Data-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming)
- [Systems design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design)
- [Smart vs presentational components](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-smart-components-vs-presentation-components-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-and-why/)
- [Separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
- [Single Responsability Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)
- [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

## Instructions

Hi and welcome to team SlädBär - you know we're cool and high tech because we spell our name in a quirky way. We aim to disrupt the salad bar industry by providing a way for salad enthusiasts to order a custom made salad online and get it delivered to their location, anywhere in the world, in less than 30 minutes or it's free. That's our wilted-free guarantee.

Over the next few sprints, we are planning improvements to our multi-step salad ordering process and you will be responsible for implementing these changes. If you are reading this README file, you have discovered the source code for SlädBär, good job. We also have a suite of end-to-end tests contained in the [projects/salad-bar-e2e/integration](../salad-bar-e2e/integration) folder.

We encourage you to first get familiar with the app and the current requirements. Before you move on to your first sprint.

### Install
